    "This problem is about the staffing of an airline, i.e. assigning pilots and crew members to scheduled flights using a Constraint Satisfaction/Optimisation Problem (CSP/COP) solver (here `facile`). Three instances of the problem are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pure CSP modelling fails for the larger instance, we will solve it using a combination of CSP and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) modelling. You may refer to past classes with the `PuLP` library for basic usage.\n",

    "\n",
    "An airline operates a given **set of flights** between **pairs of airports**. Each flight must be staffed with **two pilots** and **enough cabin crew members** depending on the **type of aircraft**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each staff member must start its trip **from his hometown (not before 12am, midday)** and be **back home in the evening (before 12am, midnight)**. They must **not fly more than a maximum number of flights per day**, and **more than a maximum amount of time out of home** (from first take-off time to last landing time in addition to commuting time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each staff member may **fly as a passenger** if they just need to be transferred to another airport/city. They may as well be **assigned to just stay home**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first search for a solution to this problem, then find the optimal solution that will **maximise the money** made by the airline by **minimising the number of passenger seats assigned to staff**."
